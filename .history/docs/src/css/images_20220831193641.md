# Images

Images are extremely important for users to avoid getting them bored with compact texts.

Ratio are useful when you want to give an image a specific width or height and letting the other untouched, while making sure the full image is shown.

Typically, you can set the image's ratio like this:

``aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;``
