# Debugging

Here is a list of problems I have encountered.

## Cannot get latest useState value inside a hook/interval

:::tip Note
Problem: I call a useEffect which will call a setInterval.
I need to use a useState value inside one of the function triggered by the interval, but I only get the initial value of the useState.
:::

**Solutions**:

### I want to update a useState value

In order to update a useState value, you need to pass the previous value inside the set function:

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
// Somewhere in a function
setCount(prev => prev + 1)
```

Here is a full example:

```js
const MyComponent = ({ parameters }) => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    let intervalId = useRef(null);
    useEffect(() => {
        createInterval();
        return () => {
            clearInterval(intervalId.current);
        }
    }, [])

    const createInterval = () =>{
        intervalId.current = setInterval(() => {
            doSomething();
          }, 1000)
    }
    const doSomething = () => {
        setCount(prev => prev + 1)
    }
	return (
	);
}
```

### I want to read a useState value

In order to read a useState value in such context, I need to create a reference which will refer to the said useState

1. Instanciate the useRef

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
let refCount = useRef(null);

refCount.current = count;
```

2. Then, you can read the update useState value by calling the reference previously instanciated.

```js
console.log(refCount.current) // Will display the latest count value, even inside a hook.
```

Here is a full example:

```js
const MyComponent = ({ parameters }) => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    let refCount = useRef(null);
    refCount.current = count;
    let intervalId = useRef(null);
    useEffect(() => {
        createInterval();
        return () => {
            clearInterval(intervalId.current);
        }
    }, [])

    const createInterval = () =>{
        intervalId.current = setInterval(() => {
            doSomething();
          }, 1000)
    }
    const doSomething = () => {
        setCount(prev => prev + 1)
        console.log(refCount.current)
    }
	return (
	);
}
```

## Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail.

:::tip Note
Problem: I tried putting a reference to a functional component which is a Child of another component, which failed as the error message suggests.
:::

**Solution**:

### Using forwardRef 

**forwardRef** allows you to call a child's method from the parent component.

1. Inside the Parent component, give the child a reference

```js
const ParentComponent = ({ navigation }) => {
    let refChild = useRef(null);
    <ChildComponent ref={refChild} />
})
```

:::warning Important
Make sure to use the right ``ref={yourRef}`` structure and not ``ref={ref => (refEating = ref)}``.
:::

2. Inside the Child component, follow this structure:

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef, forwardRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';

const ChildComponent = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
})
```

3. Inside the Child component, create the useImperativeHandle function and put all the functions you want to be able to call via the Parent in it.

```js
useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    childFunction(){
        console.log("Call this function from Parent !")
    }
}));
```

* Make sure to follow the right function structure ``childFunction(){}`` and not otherwise.

4. Call the Child's function from the Parent

```js
const parentFunction= () =>{
    refChild.current.childFunction();
}
```

* There is more documentation about forwardRef <a href="https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html" style="color:green" >here.</a>

## I want to add a specific width/height to an image without defining the other, but the image is cut.

:::tip Note
Problem: I want an image to fit the user's screen width, but I don't know which height to put to keep the image's ratio.
:::

**Solution**:

### Using Dimension to create a ratio variable

1. First, import Dimensions

```js
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';
const dimensions = Dimensions.get("window");
const width = dimensions.width;
```

2. Inside your assets folder, find your image's width and height (in pixels).

* In this case, we are going to say the width is ``200px`` and the height is ``100px``.

3. Create a variable using the dimensions and replace the ``200`` value by your image's width.

```js
const ratio = dimensions.width / 200;
```

4. Define your image's style by following the same pattern:

```css
    yourImage: {
        resizeMode: 'contain',
        width: width,
        height: 75 * ratio,
    }
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ``height`` | Don't forget to replace the ``100`` value by your image's height. |
| ``width`` | In this case we want the image to fit the user screen's width. |
| ``resizeMode`` | ResizeMode is used to make sure the image doesn't duplicate. |
