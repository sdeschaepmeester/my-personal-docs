# React Native CSS

In React Native, you usually use a const variable holding your elements's style.

Generally, you use CSS properties, but not all CSS properties are accepted by React Native.

## Image ratio 

<span id="imageRatio"></span>

::: note Note
In this example, I want an image to fit the user's screen width, but I don't know which height to put to keep the image's ratio.
:::

Follow these steps to create and use an image ratio:

1. First, import Dimensions.

```js
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';
const dimensions = Dimensions.get("window");
const width = dimensions.width;
```

2. Inside your assets folder, find your image's width and height (in pixels).

* In this case, we are going to say the width is ``200px`` and the height is ``100px``.

3. Create a variable using the dimensions and replace the ``200`` value by your image's width.

```js
const ratio = dimensions.width / 200;
```

4. Define your image's style by following the same pattern:

```css
    yourImage: {
        resizeMode: 'contain',
        width: width,
        height: 75 * ratio,
    }
```

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ``height`` | Don't forget to replace the ``100`` value by your image's height. |
| ``width`` | In this case we want the image to fit the user screen's width. |
| ``resizeMode`` | ResizeMode is used to make sure the image doesn't duplicate. |
